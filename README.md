# Expense Tracker Collab Project

## Project Description
Work in teams of 2-3 students to create a Python program that manages and tracks expenses. Each team will build an expense tracking system using dictionaries to store expense data such as categories, amounts, and dates. The goal is to use python dictionaries to organize and manage data and collaborate on Github.

## Reflection

### Team Roles & Tasks
Our group divided the tasks evenly so that everyone contributed equally. Daniel worked on adding and viewing the expenses. Adrian worked on calculating the expenses and deleting expenses. Derek handled error handling and set up the GitHub repository (README).

### Challenges and how it was overcame
One challenge our group faced was combining different parts of the code into one working program. We solved this by communicating, testing eachothers function separately, and fixing errors together.

### Enjoy collaborative coding or not?
Our group enjoyed collaborative coding because each person contributed to the code, which made less work for everybody. Working together helped us solve problems faster and understand GitHub collaboration better. Overall, working collaboratively made the project easier and also more enjoyable.
