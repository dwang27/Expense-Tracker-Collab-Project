# Expense-Tracker-Collab-Project
Work in teams of 2-3 students to create a Python program that manages and tracks expenses. Each team will build an expense tracking system using dictionaries to store expense data such as categories, amounts, and dates. The goal is to use python dictionaries to organize and manage data and collaborate on Github.
