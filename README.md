## Reflection

### Challenges and how it was overcame
One challenge our group faced was combining different parts of the code into one working program. We solved this by communicating, testing eachothers function separately, and fixing errors together.

### Enjoy collaborative coding or not?
Our group enjoyed collaborative coding because each person contributed to the code, which made less work for everybody. Working together helped us solve problems faster and understand GitHub collaboration better. Overall, working collaboratively made the project easier and also more enjoyable.
